amimoto name: |
  We named our WordPress hosting provider AMIMOTO because it runs on Amazon Web Services environment, and to launch a virtual server (like AMIMOTO) in the cloud, users need the information provided by Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

hhvm: |
  HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM) is a process virtual machine based on just-in-time (JIT) compilation that serves as an execution engine for the PHP and Hack programming languages.
  By using the principle of JIT compilation, executed PHP or Hack code is first transformed into intermediate HipHop bytecode (HHBC), which is then dynamically translated into the x86-64 machine code, optimized, and natively executed.
  This contrasts to the PHP's usual interpreted execution, in which the Zend Engine transforms the PHP source code into opcodes that serve as a form of intermediate code,
  and executes the opcodes directly on the Zend Engine's virtual CPU.HHVM is developed by Facebook, with the project's source code hosted on GitHub and licensed under the terms of PHP License and Zend License.
  
aws: |
  Amazon Web Services (AWS), is a collection of cloud computing services that make up the on-demand computing platform offered by Amazon.com.
  These services operate from twelve geographical regions across the world.
  The most central and best-known of these services arguably include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, also known as "EC2", and Amazon Simple Storage Service, also known as "S3".
  AWS now has more than seventy services that range from compute, storage, networking, database, analytics, application services, deployment, management and mobile.
  Amazon markets AWS as a service to provide large computing capacity quicker and cheaper than a client company building an actual physical server farm.
  
autoscaling: |
  Auto Scaling helps you maintain application availability and allows you to scale your Amazon EC2 capacity up or down automatically according to conditions you define.
  You can use Auto Scaling to help ensure that you are running your desired number of Amazon EC2 instances.
  Auto Scaling can also automatically increase the number of Amazon EC2 instances during demand spikes to maintain performance and decrease capacity during lulls to reduce costs.
  Auto Scaling is well suited both to applications that have stable demand patterns or that experience hourly, daily, or weekly variability in usage.
  Autoscaling automatically increases the number of instances on high demand.
  In this way, the performance of your site is maintained.
  When the traffic gets low, it will automatically decrease to also keep the cost low, making Autoscaling an effective tool for your business as it keeps the performance high, while passing the savings onto you.
