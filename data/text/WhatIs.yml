  If your account is newly created, you are entitled to free EC2 usage of 750 hours.

amimoto name: |
  We named our WordPress hosting provider AMIMOTO because it runs on Amazon Web Services environment, and to launch a virtual server (like AMIMOTO) in the cloud, users need the information provided by Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

hhvm: |
  HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM) is a process virtual machine based on just-in-time (JIT) compilation that serves as an execution engine for the PHP and Hack programming languages.
  By using the principle of JIT compilation, executed PHP or Hack code is first transformed into intermediate HipHop bytecode (HHBC), which is then dynamically translated into the x86-64 machine code, optimized, and natively executed.
  This contrasts to the PHP's usual interpreted execution, in which the Zend Engine transforms the PHP source code into opcodes that serve as a form of intermediate code,
  and executes the opcodes directly on the Zend Engine's virtual CPU.HHVM is developed by Facebook, with the project's source code hosted on GitHub and licensed under the terms of PHP License and Zend License.

aws: |
  Amazon Web Services (AWS), is a collection of cloud computing services that make up the on-demand computing platform offered by Amazon.com.
  These services operate from twelve geographical regions across the world.
  The most central and best-known of these services arguably include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, also known as "EC2", and Amazon Simple Storage Service, also known as "S3".
  AWS now has more than seventy services that range from compute, storage, networking, database, analytics, application services, deployment, management and mobile.
  Amazon markets AWS as a service to provide large computing capacity quicker and cheaper than a client company building an actual physical server farm.

autoscaling: |
  Auto Scaling helps you maintain application availability and allows you to scale your Amazon EC2 capacity up or down automatically according to conditions you define.
  You can use Auto Scaling to help ensure that you are running your desired number of Amazon EC2 instances.
  Auto Scaling can also automatically increase the number of Amazon EC2 instances during demand spikes to maintain performance and decrease capacity during lulls to reduce costs.
  Auto Scaling is well suited both to applications that have stable demand patterns or that experience hourly, daily, or weekly variability in usage.
  Autoscaling automatically increases the number of instances on high demand.
  In this way, the performance of your site is maintained.
  When the traffic gets low, it will automatically decrease to also keep the cost low, making Autoscaling an effective tool for your business as it keeps the performance high, while passing the savings onto you.

aws datacenter: |
  AMIMOTO is available to launch in any data centers.
  In Asia we have Tokyo, Singapore, Sydney and our newest one Korea.
  American region includes N. Virginia, Oregon, N. California and Sao Paulo. Here in Europe, it's in Frankfurt and Ireland.

wordpress.org: |
  On this site you can download and install a software script called WordPress.
  To do this you need a web host who meets the minimum requirements and a little time. 
  WordPress is completely customizable and can be used for almost anything. 
  There is also a service called WordPress.com which lets you get started with a new and free WordPress-based blog in seconds, but varies in several ways and is less flexible than the WordPress you download and install yourself.

wordpress use for: |
  WordPress started as just a blogging system, but has evolved to be used as full content management system and so much more through the thousands of plugins and widgets and themes, WordPress is limited only by your imagination. (And tech chops.)

wordpress community: |
  In addition to online resources like the forums and mailing lists a great way to get involved with WordPress is to attend or volunteer at a WordCamp,
  which are free or low-cost events that happen all around the world to gather and educate WordPress users, organized by WordPress users.
  Check out the website, there might be a WordCamp near you.

wordpress history: |
  WordPress was born out of a desire for an elegant, well-architectured personal publishing system built on PHP and MySQL and licensed under the GPLv2 (or later).
  It is the official successor of b2/cafelog.
  WordPress is fresh software, but its roots and development go back to 2001.
  It is a mature and stable product.
  We hope by focusing on user experience and web standards we can create a tool different from anything else out there.
  For a bit more about WordPress' history check out the WordPress Wikipedia page or this page on our own Codex.
  
wordpress features: |
  WordPress powers more than 24% of the web — a figure that rises every day.
  Everything from simple websites, to blogs, to complex portals and enterprise websites, and even applications, are built with WordPress.
  WordPress combines simplicity for users and publishers with under-the-hood complexity for developers.
  This makes it flexible while still being easy-to-use.
  The following is a list of some of the features that come as standard with WordPress; however, there are literally thousands of plugins that extend what WordPress does, so the actual functionality is nearly limitless.
  You are also free to do whatever you like with the WordPress code, extend it or modify in any way or use it for commercial projects without any licensing fees.
  That is the beauty of free software, free refers not only to price but also the freedom to have complete control over it.

wordpress license: |
  WordPress is licensed under the General Public License (GPLv2 or later) which provides four core freedoms, consider this as the WordPress "bill of rights":
  The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.
  The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.
  The freedom to redistribute.
  The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.
  Part of those licensing requirements include licensing derivative works or things that link core WordPress functions (like themes, plugins, etc.) under the GPL as well, thereby passing on the freedom of use for these works as well.
  Obviously there are those who will try to get around these ideals and restrict the freedom of their users by trying to find loopholes or somehow circumvent the intention of the WordPress licensing, which is to ensure freedom of use. We believe that the community as a whole will reward those who focus on supporting these licensing freedoms instead of trying to avoid them.
  The most responsible use of WordPress community resources would therefore be put to best use by emphasizing high quality contributions that embrace the freedoms provided by the GPL
